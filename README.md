The strategic airlift input generator was developed to automatically generate scenarios for use with the strategic airlift simulator.  This is required to generate a large volume of scenarios for the simulator to run based on configuration parameters specified by the user through a config file.

The user is able to specify the initial state of the generator which includes the number of locations the user wants to generate, connections to main logistic bases and the number of scenarios to generate. Further details about the initial state are located in the user documentation.

The generator will output scenario configuration files which the strategic airlift simulator can use to run simulations.
